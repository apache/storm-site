## Getting help

__NOTE:__ The google groups account storm-user@googlegroups.com is now officially deprecated in favor of the Apache-hosted user/dev mailing lists.

### Storm Users
Storm users should send messages and subscribe to [user@storm.apache.org](mailto:user@storm.apache.org).

You can subscribe to this list by sending an email to [user-subscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:user-subscribe@storm.apache.org). Likewise, you can cancel a subscription by sending an email to [user-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:user-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org).

You can also [browse the archives of the storm-user mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/storm-user/).

### Storm Developers
Storm developers should send messages and subscribe to [dev@storm.apache.org](mailto:dev@storm.apache.org).

You can subscribe to this list by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@storm.apache.org). Likewise, you can cancel a subscription by sending an email to [dev-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org).

You can also [browse the archives of the storm-dev mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/storm-dev/).

Storm developers who would want to track the JIRA issues should subscribe to [issues@storm.apache.org](mailto:issues@storm.apache.org).

You can subscribe to this list by sending an email to [issues-subscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:issues-subscribe@storm.apache.org). Likewise, you can cancel a subscription by sending an email to [issues-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org](mailto:issues-unsubscribe@storm.apache.org).

You can view the archives of the mailing list [here](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/storm-issues/).

### Which list should I send/subscribe to?
If you are using a pre-built binary distribution of Storm, then chances are you should send questions, comments, storm-related announcements, etc. to [user@storm.apache.org](mailto:user@storm.apache.org).

If you are building storm from source, developing new features, or otherwise hacking storm source code, then [dev@storm.apache.org](mailto:dev@storm.apache.org) is more appropriate.

If you are committers and/or PMCs, or contributors looking for following up and participating development of Storm, then you would want to also subscribe [issues@storm.apache.org](issues@storm.apache.org) in addition to [dev@storm.apache.org](dev@storm.apache.org).

#### What will happen with storm-user@googlegroups.com?
All existing messages will remain archived there, and can be accessed/searched [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/storm-user).

New messages sent to storm-user@googlegroups.com will either be rejected/bounced or replied to with a message to direct the email to the appropriate Apache-hosted group.

#### IRC
You can also come to the #storm-user room on [freenode](https://freenode.net/). You can usually find a Storm developer there to help you out.
