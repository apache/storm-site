title: Apache Storm 0.9.3 released
author: P. Taylor Goetz

We are pleased to announce that Apache Storm 0.9.3 has been released and is available from [the downloads page](/downloads.html). This release includes 100 new fixes and improvements from 62 individual contributors.

Improved Kafka Integration
----------------------------

Apache Storm has supported [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a streaming data source since version 0.9.2-incubating. Version 0.9.3 brings a number of improvements to the Kafka integration including the ability to write data to one or more Kafka clusters and topics.

The ability to both read from and write to Kafka further unlocks potential of the already powerful combination of Apache Storm and Kafka. Apache Storm users can now use Kafka as a source of and destination for streaming data. This allows for inter-topology communication, topology chaining, combining spout/bolt-based topologies with Trident-based data flows, and integration with any external system that supports data ingest from Kafka.

More information about Apache Storm's Kafka integration can be found in the [storm-kafka project documentation](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v0.9.3/external/storm-kafka/README.md).


HDFS Integration
----------------

Many stream processing use cases involve storing data in HDFS for further analysis and offline (batch) processing. Apache Storm’s HDFS integration consists of several bolt and Trident state implementations that allow topology developers to easily write data to HDFS from any Storm topology. 

More information about Apache Storm's HDFS integration can be found in the [storm-hdfs project documentation](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/v0.9.3/external/storm-hdfs).


HBase Integration
-----------------

Apache Storm’s HBase integration includes a number of components that allow Apache Storm topologies to both write to and query HBase in real-time. Many organizations use Apache HBase as part of their big data strategy for batch, interactive, and real-time workflows. Apache Storm HBase integration allows users to leverage data assets in HBase as streaming queries, as well as using HBase as a destination for streaming computation results.

More information about Apache Storm's HBase integration can be found in the [storm-hbase project documentation](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/v0.9.3/external/storm-hbase).

Reduced Dependency Conflicts
----------------------------
In previous Apache Storm releases, it was not uncommon for users' topology dependencies to conflict with the libraries used by Apache Storm. In Apache Storm 0.9.3 several dependency packages that were common sources of conflicts have been package-relocated (shaded) to avoid this situation. Developers are free to use the Storm-packaged versions, or supply their own version. 

The following table lists the dependency package relocations:

| Dependency  | Original Package | Apache Storm Package |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Apache Thrift | `org.apache.thrift` | `org.apache.thrift7` |
| Netty | `org.jboss.netty` | `org.apache.storm.netty` |
| Google Guava | `com.google.common` | `org.apache.storm.guava` |
|              | `com.google.thirdparty` | `org.apache.storm.guava.thirdparty` |
| Apache HTTPClient | `org.apache.http` | `org.apache.storm.http` |
| Apache ZooKeeper | `org.apache.zookeeper` | `org.apache.storm.zookeeper` |
| Apache Curator | `org.apache.curator` | `org.apache.storm.curator` |

Multi-Lang Improvements
-----------------------
Apache Storm 0.9.3 includes a new [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) multi-lang implementation that allows developers to write spouts and bolts in JavaScript.

In addition to the Node.js implementation, the multi-lang protocol has been substantially improved in terms of robustness and error handling capabilities. As a result, **the multi-lang API has changed in a non-backward-compatible way**. Users with existing multi-lang topologies should consult the Python, Ruby, and JavaScript multi-lang examples to determine the impact prior to upgrading.


Thanks

Special thanks are due to all those who have contributed to Apache Storm -- whether through direct code contributions, documentation, bug reports, or helping other users on the mailing lists. Your efforts are much appreciated.
