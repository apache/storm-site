<h2 id="about-storm-jms">About Storm JMS</h2>
<p>Storm JMS is a generic framework for integrating JMS messaging within the Storm framework.</p>

<p>Storm-JMS allows you to inject data into Storm via a generic JMS spout, as well as consume data from Storm via a generic JMS bolt.</p>

<p>Both the JMS Spout and JMS Bolt are data agnostic. To use them, you provide a simple Java class that bridges the JMS and Storm APIs and encapsulates and domain-specific logic.</p>

<h3 id="jms-spout">JMS Spout</h3>
<p>The JMS Spout component allows for data published to a JMS topic or queue to be consumed by a Storm topology.</p>

<p>A JMS Spout connects to a JMS Destination (topic or queue), and emits Storm “Tuple” objects based on the content of the JMS message received.</p>

<h3 id="jms-bolt">JMS Bolt</h3>
<p>The JMS Bolt component allows for data within a Storm topology to be published to a JMS destination (topic or queue).</p>

<p>A JMS Bolt connects to a JMS Destination, and publishes JMS Messages based on the Storm “Tuple” objects it receives.</p>
