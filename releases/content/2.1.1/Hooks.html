<h2 id="task-hooks">Task hooks</h2>
<p>Storm provides hooks with which you can insert custom code to run on any number of events within Storm. You create a hook by extending the <a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/hooks/BaseTaskHook.html">BaseTaskHook</a> class and overriding the appropriate method for the event you want to catch. There are two ways to register your hook:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the open method of your spout or prepare method of your bolt using the <a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/task/TopologyContext.html#addTaskHook">TopologyContext</a> method.</li>
  <li>Through the Storm configuration using the <a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/Config.html#TOPOLOGY_AUTO_TASK_HOOKS">“topology.auto.task.hooks”</a> config. These hooks are automatically registered in every spout or bolt, and are useful for doing things like integrating with a custom monitoring system.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="worker-hooks">Worker hooks</h2>
<p>Storm also provides worker-level hooks that are called during worker startup, before any bolts or spouts are prepared/opened. You can create such a hook by extending <a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/hooks/BaseWorkerHook">BaseWorkerHook</a> and overriding the methods you want to implement. You can register your hook via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TopologyBuilder.addWorkerHook</code>.</p>
