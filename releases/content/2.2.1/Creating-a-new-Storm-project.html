<p>This page outlines how to set up a Storm project for development. The steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add Storm jars to classpath</li>
  <li>If using multilang, add multilang dir to classpath</li>
</ol>

<p>Follow along to see how to set up the <a href="/examples/storm-starter">storm-starter</a> project in Eclipse.</p>

<h3 id="add-storm-jars-to-classpath">Add Storm jars to classpath</h3>

<p>You’ll need the Storm jars on your classpath to develop Storm topologies. Using <a href="Maven.html">Maven</a> is highly recommended. <a href="/examples/storm-starter/pom.xml">Here’s an example</a> of how to setup your pom.xml for a Storm project. If you don’t want to use Maven, you can include the jars from the Storm release on your classpath.</p>

<p>To set up the classpath in Eclipse, create a new Java project, include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/jvm/</code> as a source path, and make sure all the jars in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/dev/</code> are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Referenced Libraries</code> section of the project.</p>

<h3 id="if-using-multilang-add-multilang-dir-to-classpath">If using multilang, add multilang dir to classpath</h3>

<p>If you implement spouts or bolts in languages other than Java, then those implementations should be under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multilang/resources/</code> directory of the project. For Storm to find these files in local mode, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resources/</code> dir needs to be on the classpath. You can do this in Eclipse by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multilang/</code> as a source folder. You may also need to add multilang/resources as a source directory.</p>

<p>For more information on writing topologies in other languages, see <a href="Using-non-JVM-languages-with-Storm.html">Using non-JVM languages with Storm</a>.</p>

<p>To test that everything is working in Eclipse, you should now be able to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WordCountTopology.java</code> file. You will see messages being emitted at the console for 10 seconds.</p>
