<p>There are three distinct layers to Storm’s codebase.</p>

<p>First, Storm was designed from the very beginning to be compatible with multiple languages. Nimbus is a Thrift service and topologies are defined as Thrift structures. The usage of Thrift allows Storm to be used from any language.</p>

<p>Second, all of Storm’s interfaces are specified as Java interfaces. This means that every feature of Storm is always available via Java.</p>

<p>The following sections explain each of these layers in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="stormthrift">storm.thrift</h3>

<p>The first place to look to understand the structure of Storm’s codebase is the <a href="/storm-client/src/storm.thrift">storm.thrift</a> file.</p>

<p>Every spout or bolt in a topology is given a user-specified identifier called the “component id”. The component id is used to specify subscriptions from a bolt to the output streams of other spouts or bolts. A <a href="/storm-client/src/storm.thrift">StormTopology</a> structure contains a map from component id to component for each type of component (spouts and bolts).</p>

<p>Spouts and bolts have the same Thrift definition, so let’s just take a look at the <a href="/storm-client/src/storm.thrift">Thrift definition for bolts</a>. It contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComponentObject</code> struct and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComponentCommon</code> struct.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComponentObject</code> defines the implementation for the bolt. It can be one of three types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A serialized java object (that implements <a href="/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/task/IBolt.java">IBolt</a>)</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShellComponent</code> object that indicates the implementation is in another language. Specifying a bolt this way will cause Storm to instantiate a <a href="/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/task/ShellBolt.java">ShellBolt</a> object to handle the communication between the JVM-based worker process and the non-JVM-based implementation of the component.</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaObject</code> structure which tells Storm the classname and constructor arguments to use to instantiate that bolt. This is useful if you want to define a topology in a non-JVM language. This way, you can make use of JVM-based spouts and bolts without having to create and serialize a Java object yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComponentCommon</code> defines everything else for this component. This includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What streams this component emits and the metadata for each stream (whether it’s a direct stream, the fields declaration)</li>
  <li>What streams this component consumes (specified as a map from component_id:stream_id to the stream grouping to use)</li>
  <li>The parallelism for this component</li>
  <li>The component-specific <a href="Configuration.html">configuration</a> for this component</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the structure spouts also have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComponentCommon</code> field, and so spouts can also have declarations to consume other input streams. Yet the Storm Java API does not provide a way for spouts to consume other streams, and if you put any input declarations there for a spout you would get an error when you tried to submit the topology. The reason that spouts have an input declarations field is not for users to use, but for Storm itself to use. Storm adds implicit streams and bolts to the topology to set up the <a href="Acking-framework-implementation.html">acking framework</a>, and two of these implicit streams are from the acker bolt to each spout in the topology. The acker sends “ack” or “fail” messages along these streams whenever a tuple tree is detected to be completed or failed. The code that transforms the user’s topology into the runtime topology is located <a href="/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/daemon/StormCommon.java">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="java-interfaces">Java interfaces</h3>

<p>The interfaces for Storm are generally specified as Java interfaces. The main interfaces are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/topology/IRichBolt.html">IRichBolt</a></li>
  <li><a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/topology/IRichSpout.html">IRichSpout</a></li>
  <li><a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/topology/TopologyBuilder.html">TopologyBuilder</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The strategy for the majority of the interfaces is to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specify the interface using a Java interface</li>
  <li>Provide a base class that provides default implementations when appropriate</li>
</ol>

<p>You can see this strategy at work with the <a href="javadocs/org/apache/storm/topology/base/BaseRichSpout.html">BaseRichSpout</a> class.</p>

<p>Spouts and bolts are serialized into the Thrift definition of the topology as described above.</p>

<p>One subtle aspect of the interfaces is the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IBolt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ISpout</code> vs. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IRichBolt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IRichSpout</code>. The main difference between them is the addition of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">declareOutputFields</code> method in the “Rich” versions of the interfaces. The reason for the split is that the output fields declaration for each output stream needs to be part of the Thrift struct (so it can be specified from any language), but as a user you want to be able to declare the streams as part of your class. What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TopologyBuilder</code> does when constructing the Thrift representation is call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">declareOutputFields</code> to get the declaration and convert it into the Thrift structure. The conversion happens in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TopologyBuilder</code> code.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Specifying all the functionality via Java interfaces ensures that every feature of Storm is available via Java. Moreso, the focus on Java interfaces ensures that the user experience from Java-land is pleasant as well.</p>

<p>Storm was originally implemented in Clojure, but most of the code has since been ported to Java.</p>
