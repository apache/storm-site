<p>To develop topologies, you’ll need the Storm jars on your classpath. You should either include the unpacked jars in the classpath for your project or use Maven to include Storm as a development dependency. Storm is hosted on Maven Central. To include Storm in your project as a development dependency, add the following to your pom.xml:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.apache.storm<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>storm-core<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;&lt;/version&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;scope&gt;</span>provided<span class="nt">&lt;/scope&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
